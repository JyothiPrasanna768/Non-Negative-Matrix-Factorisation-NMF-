# Non-Negative-Matrix-Factorisation-NMF-
Matrix factorization is an important and unifying topic in signal processing and linear algebra,
which has found numerous applications in many other areas. 
     Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF)
has become a popular model in data mining society. NMF aims to extract
hidden patterns from a series of high-dimensional vectors automatically,
and has been applied for dimensional reduction, unsupervised learning
(clustering, semi-supervised clustering and co-clustering, etc.) and pre-
diction successfully. This chapter surveys NMF in terms of the model for-
mulation and its variations and extensions, algorithms and applications,
as well as its relations with K-means and Probabilistic Latent Seman-
tic Indexing (PLSI).
